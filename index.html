      <h3>What is Intelexit?</h3>
      <p>Intelexit is an initiative that motivates and supports people working in the secret services to quit their jobs, mostly for ethical reasons.</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Many employees of the secret services experience moral distress when they witness or inadvertently become part of crimes, lies and abuses. These people typically have no support networks to lean on and cannot talk about their concerns with anyone. They might think about leaving their job but are unsure how to go about it or where to seek advice, without jeopardizing their career or relationships.</p>

      <h3>What Intelexit does</h3>
      <p>Intelexit is first and foremost a campaign to show the human side of surveillance. We reach out to spies through public communications campaigns and also offer more individual consultation.</p>

      <h3>What we can offer</h3>
      <p>
        <ul class="enum enum-pos">
          <li>A caring human at the end of the encrypted channel of communication to us.</li>
          <li>An attempt to support whoever contacts us by matching them with the relevant experts on legal, psychological and whistleblowing matters related to a potential exit.</li>
          <li>Publishing information as we find it to help people who have questions or need help deciding.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <h3>What we cannot offer</h3>
      <p>
        <ul class="enum enum-neg">
          <li>A platform or assistance with whistlebblowing or leaks (although we can recommend who can help with that)</li>
          <li>A retreat house in the mountains where spies can recuperate.</li>
          <li>Guaranteed global help for anyone who contacts us.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Getting in touch</h3>
      <p>For a first assessment of potential support measures, we rely on enough information about individual needs and context. Of course it is crucial that anyone from the intelligence community reaching out to us makes sure to use secure communication if they don't want their departments to know about it. If you contact us via the Tor hidden service, please provide a public PGP key or a jabber channel we can use to get back to you.

      <h3>The story of Intelexit</h3>
      <p>Intelexit was started by activists from <a href="https://pen.gg" target="_blank">Peng! Collective</a> in September 2015 as a media campaign with public support from ex-NSA officer Thomas Drake. The campaign was so successful that Intelexit is now building a community of people who want to support.</p>
